==============

sgf file path defaults to Documents/sgf_files/test5.sgf.

You can use left and right keys to navigate game.

left_shift + left_arrow goes to the beginning of the game.

(**FIXED**)BUG: If you go back after a capture is made, the stone that was captured will not reappear.

There is not currently support for SGF file branches
