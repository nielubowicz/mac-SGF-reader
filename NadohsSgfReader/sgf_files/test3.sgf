C[This is the game from the 55th Japanese Oza primary tournament. \

Black is Ryu Shikun, 9-dan. White is Takemiya Masaki, 9-dan]

C[The move is typical for Lee Changho, but it's strange to see \

Takemiya, using it]

C[Another territorial-oriented move, which is not typical for Takemiya \

Masaki, 9-dan]

C[The right answer -]

first]

X, putting more pressure on White's group]

C[A careful answer -]

territory here]

balance, we may see that White is leading about 5 points.]
